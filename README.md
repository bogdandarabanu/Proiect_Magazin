# Proiect_Magazin

The project description is as follows:
It is considered a t-shirt store, where each t-shirt is characterized by ID, description, color, size and number of pieces available in the store.

I have created a Java program that allows the following operations to be performed:

Creating a t-shirt shop;
Adding new shirts to the store;
Conducting in-store T-shirt sales;
Display the store's inventory report, which includes all shirts available in the store, grouped by size and sorted alphabetically by description;
Display the store's sales report, including all t-shirts sold, grouped by size and sorted in descending order by number of units sold.
